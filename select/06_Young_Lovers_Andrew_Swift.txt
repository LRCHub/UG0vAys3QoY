Young lovers, drunk on each other
Tryna navigate their way under the covers
No idea where the night'll go
I'm riding lightning when I hold you close

Hearts igniting, lips colliding
A blur of shadows on the wall intertwining
Turning me on with every touch
I'm addicted to your body, I can't get enough

Wild fire that started with a spark
Getting higher, chasing that rush
Getting lost in a place that I know so well
Who knew heaven could be hot as hell
Young lovers
Young lovers

Young lovers, wrapped in each other
Tangled up in a kaleidoscope of colours
I don't care if i'm losing sleep
No, the world'll never be the same to me

Wild fire that started with a spark
Getting higher, chasing that rush
Getting lost in a place that I know so well
Who knew heaven could be hot as hell
Young lovers
Young lovers
Young lovers
Under the covers

WIld fire, that started with a spark
Getting higher, chasing that rush
Wild fire that started with a spark
Getting higher, chasing that rush
Getting lost in a place that I know so well
Who knew heaven could be hot as hell
Young lovers
Young lovers
Young lovers
Under the covers

Young lovers, drunk on each other
Tryna navigate their way under the covers
