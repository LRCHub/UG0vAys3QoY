My lover's charms are in a box
Beneath my bed
And piece by piece I'll cherish them
Until the end

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven

They burn my hands, scar my face
And blind my eyes
I steal your breath and throw away
What I despise

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven

Between these walls and darkened halls
I've done my time
If I should die before I wake
Then you'll know why

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I'm afraid I'll never get to heaven

Piece by piece
Piece by piece

Send me an angel
Piece by piece
Send me an angel
Piece by piece

Send me an angel
Piece by piece
Send me an angel
Piece by piece

Send me an angel
Piece by piece
Send me an angel
Piece by piece

Send me an angel
Piece by piece
Send me an angel
