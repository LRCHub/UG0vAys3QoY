Lonely women make good lovers
They all have mercy for good lookin' smooth talkin' men
Lonely women make good lovers
If you got a woman you better treat her just as good as you can.

Lots of times a lonely girl will go out on the town
With no thoughts of evil on her mind
She don't try to flat that seat
Lord knows there's something every woman needs
Friendly smile will do it, every time.

Lonely women make good lovers
They all have mercy for good lookin' smooth talkin' men
Lonely women make good lovers
If you got a woman you better treat her just as good as you can.

Once a woman's tasted love, she can't do without
She'll search for something more
When she gets cold
And if her lips are wet with wine
When it comes to lovin' time
She'll trade her pride for something
Warm to hold.

Lonely women make good lovers
They all have mercy for good lookin' smooth talkin' men
Lonely women make good lovers
If you got a woman you better treat her just as good as you can.
