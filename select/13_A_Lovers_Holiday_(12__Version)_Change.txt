Not a cloud showed out in the sky
That very night in Pitch Black City
I was so damned scared, it was dark
It was so dim, it was a shame
Just then a man walked up to me and said
Didn't I see you here before
The lights were low and the party was so dull
Just not good enough

Holiday (Ey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
Holiday (Holiday, what you say)
Holiday
Celebrate (Ah yeah)

Holiday
Holiday (Alright)
Holiday
Celebrate

Then we both held hands in each other's
For a chance to start it moving
He reached deep inside of his vest
And in his hand he held a ring
Let's have lunch, picnic or a brunch in the wintertime
Let's disco down in a rollerskating ring in Alaska town

Holiday (Holiday)
Holiday (Come on, come on celebrate)
Holiday (Woo, woo, woo, woo)
Celebrate

Holiday (Got the feeling, come on, keep ahead)
Holiday (Reelin' holiday, yea, yea)
Holiday
Celebrate

Not a cloud showed out in the sky
That very night in Pitch Black City
I was so damned scared, it was dark
It was so dim, it was a shame
Just then a man walked up to me and said
Didn't I see you here before
The lights were low and the party was so dull
Just not good enough

Holiday
Holiday
Holiday
Celebrate

(Repeat)
