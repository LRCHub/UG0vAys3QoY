[00:35.20] Lovers, keep on the road you're on
[00:43.71] Runners, until the race is run
[00:52.42] Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
[01:01.02] Sometimes even right is wrong
[01:15.52] 
[01:09.40] They are turning my head out
[01:16.49] To see what I'm all about
[01:20.27] Keeping my head down
[01:24.86] To see what it feels like now
[01:29.34] But I have no doubt
[01:33.91] One day, we're gonna get out
[01:47.91] 
[01:55.87] Tonight maybe we're gonna run
[02:04.41] Dreaming of the Osaka sun
[02:16.91] 
[02:12.92] Oh, oh
[02:21.84] Dreaming of when the morning comes
[02:30.14] They are turning my head out
[02:37.01] To see what I'm all about
[02:40.96] Keeping my head down
[02:45.68] To see what it feels like now
[03:00.18] 
[02:50.03] But I have no doubt
[02:54.56] One day the sun will come out
[03:09.06] 
[04:36.36] Reign of love
[04:39.89] I can't let go
[04:44.03] To the sea I offer this heavy load
[04:52.07] Locusts will lift me up
[04:59.98] I'm just a prisoner in a Reign of Love
[05:18.98] 
[05:24.05] Locusts will let us stop
[05:31.76] I wish I'd spoken to the Reign of Love
[05:50.76] 
[05:39.60] Reign of Love
[05:43.17] By the church, we're waiting
[05:47.33] Reign of love
[05:50.90] My knees go praying
[05:55.37] How I wish I'd spoken up
[06:03.15] Or we'd be carried in the Reign of Love
